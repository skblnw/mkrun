> How to use these scripts
1. sh prepare.sh
2. sh run.sh

prepare.sh:
It prepares a water box (estimate your own atom numbers) and mininmizes automatically using Gromacs

run.sh:
It runs an MD from inputs produced by "prepare.sh" also using Gromacs

grep.sh:
It greps the benchmark numbers from multiple logs so you can plot it

> Estimate your own atom numbers
"-box 10 10 10 -maxsol 32000" serves as a standard box of 32000 waters, therefore 32000x3=96000 atoms
To increase the number of atoms, also increase the box a little bit. Remember a 10% increase in length leads to ~30% in volume as 1.1^3=1.331

> How to benchmarking
Change mdrun options in "run.sh" or write another bash looping "run.sh"
