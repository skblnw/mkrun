; TIMESTEP IN MARTINI 
; Most simulations are numerically stable with dt=40 fs, 
; however better energy conservation is achieved using a 
; 20-30 fs timestep. 
; Time steps smaller than 20 fs are not required unless specifically stated in the itp file.

; NEIGHBOURLIST and MARTINI 
; To achieve faster simulations in combination with the Verlet-neighborlist
; scheme, Martini can be simulated with a straight cutoff. In order to 
; do so, the cutoff distance is reduced 1.1 nm. 
; Neighborlist length should be optimized depending on your hardware setup:
; updating ever 20 steps should be fine for classic systems, while updating
; every 30-40 steps might be better for GPU based systems.
; The Verlet neighborlist scheme will automatically choose a proper neighborlist
; length, based on a energy drift tolerance.
;
; Coulomb interactions can alternatively be treated using a reaction-field,
; giving slightly better properties.
; Please realize that electrostVatic interactions in the Martini model are 
; not considered to be very accurate to begin with, especially as the 
; screening in the system is set to be uniform across the system with 
; a screening constant of 15. When using PME, please make sure your 
; system properties are still reasonable.
;
; With the polarizable water model, the relative electrostatic screening 
; (epsilon_r) should have a value of 2.5, representative of a low-dielectric
; apolar solvent. The polarizable water itself will perform the explicit screening
; in aqueous environment. In this case, the use of PME is more realistic.

;verlet-buffer-tolerance  = 0.005


; MARTINI and NONBONDED 
; Standard cut-off schemes are used for the non-bonded interactions 
; in the Martini model: LJ interactions are shifted to zero in the 
; range 0.9-1.2 nm, and electrostatic interactions in the range 0.0-1.2 nm. 
; The treatment of the non-bonded cut-offs is considered to be part of 
; the force field parameterization, so we recommend not to touch these 
; values as they will alter the overall balance of the force field.
; In principle you can include long range electrostatics through the use
; of PME, which could be more realistic in certain applications 
; Please realize that electrostatic interactions in the Martini model are 
; not considered to be very accurate to begin with, especially as the 
; screening in the system is set to be uniform across the system with 
; a screening constant of 15. When using PME, please make sure your 
; system properties are still reasonable.
