  Dry Martini, a coarse grained implicit water force field for (bio)molecular simulations
  (in review)

This package includes itp and mdp files for running simulations without aqueous solvent with
Martini. The files have been tested to work with Gromacs >4.5.x packages.

The package contains:
  dry_martini_v2.1.itp            The general force field and interaction parameters
  dry_martini_v2.1_lipids.itp     Updated lipid models for Dry Martini (some bonded parameters are
                                  changed from standard Martini)
  dry_martini_v2.1_lipids.itp     Updated cholesterol model for Dry Martini (one bead type and
                                  out-of-plane beads protrusion slightly modified)
  dry_martini_v2.1_solvents.itp   Updated models for simple solvents for Dry Martini
  dry_martini_v2.1_ions.itp       Models for Dry Martini ions
  template_sd.mdp                 Suggested simulation parameters for Dry Martini simulations

Bilayer simulations with Dry Martini should be performed with semi-isotropic pressure coupling. The
box should be fixed along the axis parallel to the bilayer normal (compressibility set to zero).
Bilayers are supposed to be run tensionless and therefore the pressure along axis perpendicular to
the bilayer normal should be set to zero.

This version of the force field is not optimized for protein simulations and it is not recommended
for such simulations.
