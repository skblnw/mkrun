This direction gives an example to run a Gromacs simulation for a patch
of DOPC lipid bilayer. It shows the whole process of running both the 
optimization and equilibration.

The length for all the similations are very short as a demonstration. Please
increase the step as needed.

Inputs:

run.sh
    an example shell script for runnning the whole process, detailed
    descriptions inside. 
dopc.gro
    initial configuration for the membrane bilayer
table_NON_NON.xvg, table_SOL_NON.xvg, table_SOL_SOL.xvg
    interaction tables for different components
index.ndx
    index file for different components so that tables could be used
martini_v2.1_bmw.itp
    BMW-MARTINI force field file, includes all the type definition and
    water topology
martini_v2.1_tmp.itp
    same as martini_v2.1_bmw.itp but with flexible BMW water for the
    first step in optimization
martini_lipids_bmw.itp
    lipid topology file
bmw_membrane.top
    topology file for force field definition and system components
flexible.top
    same as bmw_membrane.top but with flexible water definition
bmw_minimize.mdp, bmw_nvt.mdp, bmw_membrane.mdp
    md parameter files for minimization, NVT simulation and NPxyPzT
    simulation

selected outputs:

em1.tpr, em2.tpr, equ1.tpr, equ2.tpr
    outputs from grompp (inputs for mdrun) for minimizations and 
    equilibrations
opt1.gro, opt2.gro, endequ1.gro, endequ2.gro
    output configurations for minimizations and equilibrations
outem1.log, outem2.log, outequ1.log, outequ2.log
    log files
equ1.xtc, equ2.xtc
    trajectories for NVT and NPxyPzT equilibrations
equ1.cpt, equ2.cpt
    check point files, equ2.cpt can be used to generate later
    production run inputs
eequ2.edr
    energy file
