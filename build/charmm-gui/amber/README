# This folder contains AMBER formatted CHARMM36 force fields, a pre-optimized PDB structure, and AMBER inputs.
# All input files were optimized for AMBER14 or above, so lower version of AMBER can cause some errors.
# CHARMM36 FF to AMBER format conversion was done by ParmEd, written by Jason Swails and available at
# http://github.com/ParmEd/ParmEd. In this script, the parallel (MPI) version is commented out. Use this line
# for parallel execution instead (adjust for your MPI and the number of CPUs you want to use). Alternatively,
# if you have access to pmemd and/or pmemd.cuda, you can replace "sander" with pmemd or pmemd.cuda and "sander.MPI" with
# pmemd.MPI or pmemd.cuda.MPI

# In the case that there is a problem during minimization using a pmemd.cuda, please try to use sander only for
